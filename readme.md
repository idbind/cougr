Cross OpenID User Group Management Service (COUGr)
==================================================

The Cross OpenID User Group Management Service (COUGr) lets OpenID Connect (OIDC) users to manage their groups at this centralized service. Other applications could then query for and update this group information, allowing for groups to be synced across multiple applications.

There are two main parts to this service:

1. Web front-end interface for users to perform group management actions such as creating groups and joining/leaving groups. Users login to the COUGr front-end web application using OIDC.
2. OAuth-protected RESTful Web API endpoints for service to directly query for group information and update group information at COUGr.

To get started, you will need to have an existing OIDC server and set up the appropriate OIDC/OAuth configuration in src/main/resources/websecurity.properties. The current Spring configuration assumes that the OAuth server is the same as the OIDC server, but you can use separate ones by rewiring clientConfigurationService and serverConfigurationService in OAuthProtectedResourceConfiguration.java.

Currently, OIDC users are mapped to their local COUGr user entity via the hardcoded information in org.mitre.cougr.service.FakeDataService. You will need to update these accordingly, or set up your own persistence for local COUGr user entities.
